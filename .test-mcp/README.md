## Test Results ✅

All write operations are **WORKING**:

- ✅ `create_directory` - Successfully created `.test-mcp` directory
- ✅ `write_file` - Successfully created `test-write.txt`
- ✅ `edit_file` - Successfully edited file with line-based changes
- ✅ `read_text_file` - Successfully read created files
- ✅ `list_directory` - Successfully listed directory contents

## Conclusion

The filesystem MCP is fully operational with **read AND write** access enabled!

You can safely delete this test directory when done.
