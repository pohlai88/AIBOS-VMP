## 📝 Rationale for Removals

### Historical Documentation
- All upgrade, audit, and migration docs were from earlier versions (v1.7.0, pre-v2.0.0)
- Information is now consolidated in the active design system contract
- Implementation details are captured in current reference docs

### Redundant Documentation
- Multiple audit reports covered the same topics
- Analysis docs were replaced by comprehensive reference guides
- Implementation summaries were consolidated
- Setup completion docs were redundant with project improvements doc

### Outdated/Not Relevant
- GitHub MCP servers guide was not relevant to current project focus
- Historical improvements list was redundant with project improvements doc

2. ⏭️ Keep documentation up-to-date as system evolves
3. ⏭️ Update design system contract when making changes
4. ⏭️ Maintain utility classes reference as utilities are added
