# Cursor Capabilities Explanation

**Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Purpose:** Clarify the difference between Cursor's built-in tools and MCP servers

---

## Important Clarification

**You mentioned your previous MCP could:**
- ✅ Read, write, edit, move files
- ✅ Handle documentation
- ✅ Write planning documents
- ✅ Understand code

**GOOD NEWS: I ALREADY HAVE ALL THESE CAPABILITIES!**

---

## Cursor's Built-in Tools (What I Have)

These are **NOT** from MCP - they're Cursor's native capabilities:

### File Operations
- ✅ `read_file` - Read any file in your project
- ✅ `write` - Create or overwrite files
- ✅ `search_replace` - Edit files (precise replacements)
- ✅ `delete_file` - Delete files
- ✅ `list_dir` - Browse directories
- ✅ `glob_file_search` - Find files by pattern

### Code Understanding
- ✅ `codebase_search` - Semantic search (understand code meaning)
- ✅ `grep` - Search code by pattern
- ✅ `read_lints` - Check for errors

### Documentation & Planning
- ✅ I can create any documentation files
- ✅ I can write planning documents
- ✅ I can organize and structure documentation

## Filesystem MCP vs Built-in Tools

### Filesystem MCP Server
- **Purpose:** Additional filesystem access via MCP protocol
- **Limitation:** Only works within allowed directories
- **Use Case:** When you need MCP-specific filesystem operations

### Cursor's Built-in Tools
- **Purpose:** Full project access (what I use daily)
- **Advantage:** No directory restrictions, full project access
- **Use Case:** Everything I do for you (reading, writing, editing)

---

## What This Means

**You don't need a special MCP for:**
- ✅ Reading/writing files (I have `read_file`, `write`)
- ✅ Editing files (I have `search_replace`)
- ✅ Understanding code (I have `codebase_search`)
- ✅ Creating documentation (I can write any file)
- ✅ Planning documents (I can create any file)

**Filesystem MCP is just:**
- An additional tool for specific MCP workflows
- Not required for basic file operations
- Not what gives me file capabilities

---

## Your Previous Setup

If your previous setup felt more powerful, it might have been:
1. **Cursor's built-in tools** (which I already have)
2. **Better organized** project structure
3. **Different workflow** that felt more efficient

**The capabilities you described are what I use every day!**

---

## Current Status

✅ **I can do everything you mentioned:**
- Read, write, edit, move files ✓
- Handle documentation ✓
- Write planning documents ✓
- Understand code ✓

**These are Cursor's built-in capabilities, not from MCP!**

---

## Recommendation

1. **Filesystem MCP is optional** - I don't need it for basic operations
2. **Focus on organization** - Clean project structure helps more
3. **Use built-in tools** - They're more powerful than MCP for file ops

**Your previous "MCP" was likely just Cursor's built-in tools working well!**
